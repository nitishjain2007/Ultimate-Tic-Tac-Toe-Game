For adding more crisp to the game, I have added a rule:

If a player plays in the corner of a cell, then inspite of just getting the chance of moving in one grid he get's two additional, the one's connected to it except for it's diagonal one.

The game can be played Human vs Human and Human vs Bot

How to run: 
Run it by typing "python ultimate_tic_tac_toe.py " + "1"-> for Human vs Human
                                                   + "2" -> for Human vs Bot
